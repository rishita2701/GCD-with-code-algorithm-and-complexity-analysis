# GCD-with-code-algorithm-and-complexity-analysis
The GCD of two or more integers is the largest integer that divides each of the integers such that their remainder is zero. Or we say that GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them.    Example-  GCD of 20, 30 = 10 (10 is the largest number which divides 20 and 30 with remainder as 0)  GCD of 42, 120, 285 = 3 (3 is the largest number which divides 42, 120 and 285 with remainder as 0)
